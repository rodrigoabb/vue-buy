# Vue Buy - Simple E-commerce app

This is simple e-commerce app, developed with Vue where you can smart-buy art!. Here you can find mocked art pieces, add it to your cart and fake-buy them!

<br/>

### The simple e-commerce application has:
- “Add/Remove to Bag” and “Add/Remove to Wishlist” actions (on client side only)
- Each page shows a list of 6 products, and has a pagination component to navigate between pages (configurable)
- The cart in the header updates with the new quantities and the new total price
- A cart dropdown shows products currently added to the bag, with the possibility of removing them

### What has been used?:
- vue-cli has been used for starting project
- Mocked data (first obtained from [random-product-api](https://github.com/rodrigoabb/random-products-api)) and mocked request calls are used for showing purposes, but easily changeable to real api calls (which will be done in future release)
- Code has been written thinking on modularity, reusability and performance, as requested. Also it's well documented
- Build and other task instructions are provided at the end of this README.md.
- Logo generated by [hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/), a Shopify great & free logo maker.
- No external resource has been linked from appication.
